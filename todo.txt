Whats done:
1. EKS infrastructure provisioned with Terraform + Terragrunt
2. Kubernetes application manifests organised in a Kustomize compatible folder structure (`k8s/`), with separate overlays different environments

Todo:
1. Setup a zenml stack to run in EKS, and connected to MLFlow
2. Deploy a fast api endpoint to cluster
3. Setup a complete local stack that runs on a self hosted MySQL DB, and Minio object store (Dev stack)
4. Provision a MySQL RDS on AWS and connect MLFlow and ZenML to this RDS for a prod environment (Prod stack)
5. (3, 4) to make use of Kustomize compatibile manifests. Create an overlap within K8s to easily provision the dev stack with one command
6. Setup a simple model endpoint for inference
7. Monitoring for data drift and model drift
